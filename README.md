# Barcelona traffic incidents analysis & insights

This project offers an in-depth analysis of the data collected by the Guardia Urbana (Barcelona's city police) on traffic incidents. All the data is available at [Open Data BCN](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en).

The project is presented in a Jupyter notebook, and structured into different sections, each one dealing with different aspects, as described here:

## Objective
